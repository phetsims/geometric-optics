## Introduction

This document contains notes related to the implementation of _Geometric Optics_. This is not an exhaustive description
of the implementation. The intention is to provide a concise high-level overview, and to supplement the internal
documentation
(source code comments) and external documentation (design documents).

Before reading this document, please read:

* [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/model.md), a high-level description of the
  simulation model

In addition to this document, you are encouraged to read:

* [PhET Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-development-overview.md)
* [PhET Software Design Patterns](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md)
* [Geometric Optics HTML5 design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVxM-ax2UyxctbclAhutrRad5A0eeLWKFQNB4U7ls4o/edit) (
  definitely incomplete and out of date, but worth a look)

## General Considerations

### Model-View Transforms

This simulation makes use of 2 model-view transforms to map model coordinates (in cm) to view coordinates.

The first transform is a static mapping, see `modelViewTransform` in `GOScreenView`. The model has +x to the left, and
+y up, and scaling is isometric in both directions. In the _Lens_ screen, the origin (0,0) in the model coordinate frame
is near the center of the ScreenView. In the _Mirror_ screen, the origin is shifted to the right, to accommodate the
behavior of mirrors.

The second transform is a dynamic mapping, based on zoom level, see `zoomTransformProperty` in `GOScreenView`. This
transform is applied to all elements within a "scene" (optic, objects, images, rays, projection screen).

Rulers change their tick marks to match the zoom level, but otherwise do not change their position or size.

Labels change their position to match the zoom level, but do not change their size.

### Query Parameters

Query parameters are used to enable sim-specific features. Sim-specific query parameters are documented
in `GOQueryParameters.ts`. Running with `?log` will print the complete set of query parameters (common-code, PhET-iO,
and sim-specific)
to the browser console.

### Memory Management

* **Dynamic allocation:** Most objects in this sim are allocated at startup, and exist for the lifetime of the
  simulation. The exception is `GOPreferencesNode` and its children, which must all implement `dispose`. This is the
  content for the Simulations tab of the Preferences dialog, whose instantiation is deferred until the user presses the
  Preferences button in the navigation bar.

* **Listeners**: Unless otherwise noted in the code, all uses of `link`, `addListener`, etc. do NOT need a
  corresponding `unlink`, `removeListener`, etc.

* **dispose**: All classes have a `dispose` method, possibly inherited from a super class. Sim-specific classes whose
  instances exist for the lifetime of the sim are not intended to be disposed. They are created
  with `isDisposable: false`, or have a `dispose` method that looks like this:

```ts
public dispose(): void {
  Disposable.assertNotDisposable();
}
```

## Optics

The sim supports two types of optic, with multiple surface types: lens (concave, convex) and mirror (concave, convex,
flat). Both surfaces of the optic have the same type. A single optic instance is used for each screen, shared by all
scenes in the screen.

A relatively complex part of the optic model implementation is that it supports 2 focal-length models:

* direct: focal length is settable, IOR is fixed, ROC is derived
* indirect: ROC and IOR are settable, focal length is derived

The user can switch between focal-length models via radio buttons in the Simulation tab of the Preferences dialog.

The important classes are:

```
// model class hierarchy
Optic
  Lens
  Mirror
  
OpticShapes
  LensShapes
  MirrorShapes
  
FocalLengthModel
  DirectFocalLengthModel
  IndirectFocalLengthModel
  
// view class hierarchy
OpticNode
  LensNode
  MirrorNode
```

## Optical Objects

In geometric optics, an **object** is anything that can be viewed. Since that term conflicts with the name of
JavaScript's `Object` class, we use **optical object** in the code where there is potential for confusion.

Three types of optical object are implemented in this sim:

* **Arrow**: the most common representation used in geometric optics courses. The arrow is drawn perpendicular to the
  optical axis, and its tail is always on the optical axis.
* **Framed Object**: an object shown in a picture frame, in 3D perspective. The 3D perspective presents some additional
  implementation challenges, which we'll discuss in the *
  *[3D Perspective](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md#3d-perspective)**
  section.
* **Light**: point light sources

`OpticalObjectChoice` is a rich enumeration of optical objects. While there are 3 choices of framed object (Pencil,
Penguin, Star), those choices simply change the PNG files used to represent the single framed
object.  `OpticalObjectChoiceComboBox`, in the upper-left corner of the screen, is used to select one of the values
from `OpticalObjectChoice`.

Important classes for the optical object are:

```
// model class hierarchy
OpticalObject
  ArrowObject
  HTMLImageElementObject
    FramedObject
    LightObject

// view class hierarchy:
OpticalObjectNode
  ArrowObjectNode
  FramedObjectNode
  LightObjectNode
```

For the framed object, a second "point of interest" is also implemented. See `SecondPoint` and `SecondPointNode`.

## Optical Images

In geometric optics, an **image** is the likeness of an object produced at a point in space by an optic. Since that term
conflicts with the name of PhET's `scenery.Image` class, we use **optical image** in the code where there is potential
for confusion.

Arrows and framed objects have associated optical images; lights do not. So the important classes are:

```
// model class hierarchy
OpticalImage
  ArrowImage
  FramedImage

// view class hierarchy
OpticalImageNode
  ArrowImageNode
  FramedImageNode
```

Arrow images do not uniformly scale with magnification. The dimensions of the arrows head and tail remain constant, and
only the magnitude changes.

Framed images scale uniformly with magnification, and have variable opacity (see `opactityProperty` in `FramedImage`).
We wanted to independently control how well the occluded parts of the optical axis and rays could be seen through the
image. So an additional mask was added behind the image. See `FramedImageMaskNode`.

## Projection Screen

While this is labeled "Screen" in the view, that term conflicts with the name of PhET's `joist.Screen` class, so we use
**projection screen** throughout the code.

As mentioned in the **Optical Images** section, lights form no optical image. Instead, they cast light spots on a
projection screen.

The important classes are:

```
// model
ProjectionScreen
LightSpot

// view
ProjectionScreenNode
LightSpotNode
```

## Rays

Light rays propagate from a point on an optical object, and interact with the optic. In the case of arrows and framed
objects, an optical image is formed. In the case of lights, light spots appear where the rays hit the projection screen.

This sim has a relatively complicated ray tracer, which is also responsible for animation of rays. Instead of
duplicating what's already in the source code, we'll point you to the important classes:

```
// model
LightRays - a bundle of light rays that propagate from a point on an optical object
LightRay - a single light ray
GORay - a subclass of phet.dot.Ray2 that adds functionality

// view class hierachy
LightRaysNode - base class
  RealLightRaysNode - renders real rays as solid lines
  VirtualLightRaysNode - renders virtual rays as dashed lines
```

## Guides

Guides are a representation invented by PhET, and are described
in [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/model.md). They are hidden behind query
parameter `addGuidesCheckbox`.

The important classes are:

```
// model
Guide - a single guide
Guides - a pair of guides

// view
GuideNode - a single guide
GuidesNode - a pair of guides
```

## 3D Perspective

Since the framed objects/images have 3D perspective, we want the optical axis and rays to look like they are passing
through the object/images. This is accomplished by drawing 2 copies of the axis and real rays, one behind the
objects/images and one in front of the objects/images. The copy in front uses a `clipArea` to show only the parts of the
axis and rays that are not occluded by the object/image - see `OpticalAxisForegroundNode`
and `RealLightRaysForegroundNode`.

The projection screen also has 3D perspective. To make the optical axis look like it passes through the screen, we
similarly draw 2 copies of the axis. A `clipArea` is not necessary, and the front axis simply stops where it meets the
center of the screen. See `OpticalAxisInFrontOfProjectionScreenNode`.

## Scenes

There is one scene for each type of optical object (arrow, framed object, light). Things that are the responsibility of
a scene include:

* optical objects
* optical images
* light rays
* focal points & 2F points
* optical axis
* projection screen & light spots
* guides

A single optic instance (lens or mirror) is shared by all scenes, as are the controls and tools.

Each scene has an associated collection of labels, see
the [Labels](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md#labels) section below.

The important classes are:

```
// model class hierarchy
GOScene
  ArrowScene
  FramedObjectScene
  LightScene

// view class hierarchy
GOSceneNode
  ArrowSceneNode
  FramedObjectSceneNode
  LightSceneNode
```

Making a selection from `OpticalObjectComboBox` may or may not result in changing the scene. If switching between framed
objects, the scene does not change; the PNG files used for the framed object are changed. For example, switching from "
Pencil" to "Arrow" will switch from `FramedObjectScene` to `ArrowScene`. Switching from "Pencil" to "Penguin" will not
change the scene, but will change from pencil PNG files to penguin PNG files for the optical object and image
in `FramedObjectScene`.

Note that while the Light scene is relevant for the _Lens_ screen only, it was cleaner (and straightforward) to
implement it as an option to the base classes for the model (`GOModel`) and view (`GOScreenView`). So you'll find things
related to the Light scene in the `js/common/` subdirectory, rather than `js/lens/`.

## Tools

The sim has two types of tools: rulers and position markers. For each screen, two instances of each tool are
instantiated (model and view) when the sim starts, and exist for the lifetime of the simulation. There is no dynamic
creation of tools. One set of tools is shared by all scenes. The tools do not change position when switching scenes, or
when zooming in/out.

Tools live in a toolbox, see `GOToolbox` and `GOToolboxNode`. Tools move in and out of the toolbox
via `isInToolboxProperty`, defined in `GOTool`.

See `js/common/model/tools/` and `js/common/view/tools/` for all source code related to tools.

See `GOToolDragListener` for mouse/touch drag handling, `GOToolKeyboardDragListener` for keyboard drag handling.

Tools support 2 hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts):

* `ESCAPE` returns the tool to the toolbox
* `J` jumps (moves) the tool to "interesting points", cycling through those points from left-to-right

The "jump" hotkey is relatively complicated. A list of interesting points is provided by the scene, see `toolJumpPoints`
and `opticJumpPoints`. Each tool filters the list of points, then handles jumping to the next point, see `jumpToPoint`.
Since each scene has a list of points, and one set of tools is shared by all scenes, the list of points must be set when
the scene changes, see `setJumpPoints`.

## Labels

The Labels feature shows labels for things of interest in a scene. Each scene has an associated set of labels, made
visible when that scene is selected (if the "Labels" checkbox is checked). Those "collection" classes are:

```
GOLabelsNode
  ArrowLabelsNode
  FramedObjectLabelsNode
  LightLabelsNode
```

When the thing that a label is associated with is not visible, the label is not visible. When zooming in/out, a label
moves with the thing that it's labeling, but does not change its scale (i.e. font size remains constant).

See `js/common/view/labels/` for all source code related to the Labels feature.

## Controls

Most of the controls are straightforward, nothing too challenging or unusual in the implementation. From top-to-bottom,
left-to-right as they appear in the UI, here are the classes for the controls:

```
OpticalObjectChoiceComboBox - combo box for selecting optical object / scene
ObjectDragModeToggleButton - toggle button used to lock dragging to horizontal
OpticSurfaceTypeRadioButtonGroup - radio buttons for choosing the surface type of the optic
zoomButtonGroup - zoom buttons, in GOScreenView.ts
LightPropagationToggleButton - toggle button for turning light propagation on/off
GOControlPanel - the main control panel
```

For controls that appear in the Simulation tab of the Preferences dialog, start with `GOPreferencesNode.ts`.

## Hollywood!

To write well-behaved programs, it's not always possible to be physically accurate. This section enumerates the places
where we have "Hollywooded" things to provide close approximations and convincing behavior.

* Physical mirrors do not have an index of refraction. Our mirror is modeled as a lens with index of refraction = 2.
  See `INDEX_OF_REFRACTION_RANGE` in `Mirror.ts`.

* A flat mirror is modeled as a convex mirror with very large focal length. See `FLAT_MIRROR_FINITE_FOCAL_LENGTH`
  in `Optic.ts`. PhET-iO clients should therefore be warned that model Properties are not accurate for the flat mirror.
  For example, focal length will be a very large number, not infinity.

* The shape of the lens, as well as the refraction of the rays within the lens, is "Hollywooded". This leads to a few
  artifacts that we have attempted to minimize. See the `isHollywooded` option to `LensShapes.ts`.

* To ensure that rays pass through the optic, the optical object is always at least 40 cm from the optic, and never more
  than 100 cm from the optical axis. See `MIN_DISTANCE_FROM_OBJECT_TO_OPTIC`
  and `MAX_DISTANCE_FROM_OBJECT_TO_OPTICAL_AXIS` in `GOConstants.ts`. The arrow magnitude is limited for the same
  reasons, see `ArrowObject.MAX_MAGNITUDE`

* To ensure that at least 2 rays pass through the optic, the "Many" mode for Rays dynamically varies the number of rays
  based on the object's distance from the object. See `'many'` in `LightRays.ts`.

* The opacity of framed images is derived from several quantities and tuned constants. See `opactityProperty`
  in `FramedImage`.

## Sound

All sounds are provided by common-code UI components. There are currently no sounds associated with sim-specific UI
components and interactions.

## Alternative Input

To identify focus traversal order, search for `pdomOrder`.

To identify sim-specific support for keyboard input, search for `tagName`. These classes have custom input listeners
that handle keyboard events (e.g. `KeyboardDragListener`).

To identify hotkeys, search for `addHotkey`.

Setting focus for tools is done via tab traversal. This sim does not use `GrabDragInteraction`.

## PhET-iO

The PhET-iO instrumentation of this sim is relatively straightforward. As described
in [Memory Management](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md#memory-management),
everything in this sim is created at startup, and exists for the lifetime of the sim. So there is no sim-specific use of
PhetioGroup or PhetioCapsule.
